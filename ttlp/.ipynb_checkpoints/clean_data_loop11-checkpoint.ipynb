Mytax was the only option that spoke of rental schedules but that didn't correlate with the scenario of multiple properties that you set at the beginning of the tasks. However as it was the only option (after clicking all three) that the words rental in it, I would choose this option to start and check to see if it was right as I progressed.  i just explained that in my last answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "35   There's a heading for 'Lodged with myTax before' heading but not one for those who haven't lodged with myTax before - shouldn't information cover both scenarios. The myTax content could be worded better. If you've lodged before you already know you can use any device and there's nothing to download. Those points would be more appropriate for those who haven't used it before. Why is there a 'Start you tax return with myTax' box followed by 3 other lodgement boxes in a different style?

       "107  The 3 different methods of lodgement have very different looks to them and are all navigated differently. myTax has little information at the top and a number of drop down information boxes that explain each heading. Tax agents just have all of the information up front, and paper returns have myTax information and then paper return options. this seems to be clunky and doesn't really flow across all 3 types of lodgement. Also the demographic that would lodge via paper are either unwilling or unable to lodge online so the myTax messaging doesn't seem to take the customer experience for this audience segment into account.

Also do most people have a my gov account? - I would suggest a choice of butttons more like _ \"I have my MyGov details - Lodge now\" / \"I need to register to get a My give account\" / or \"remind me about my MyGov Account\"   \n",

The page reads like you must have used myTax previously. There also needs to be a clearer link between myGov and myTax, people say they can lodge via myGov not myTax so we need to make the language user friendly and show some of the more common language used rather than just using ATO terms.                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Mytax was the only option that spoke of rental schedules but that didn't correlate with the scenario of multiple properties that you set at the beginning of the tasks. However as it was the only option (after clicking all three) that the words rental in it, I would choose this option to start and check to see if it was right as I progressed.  i just explained that in my last answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "35   There's a heading for 'Lodged with myTax before' heading but not one for those who haven't lodged with myTax before - shouldn't information cover both scenarios. The myTax content could be worded better. If you've lodged before you already know you can use any device and there's nothing to download. Those points would be more appropriate for those who haven't used it before. Why is there a 'Start you tax return with myTax' box followed by 3 other lodgement boxes in a different style?

       "107  The 3 different methods of lodgement have very different looks to them and are all navigated differently. myTax has little information at the top and a number of drop down information boxes that explain each heading. Tax agents just have all of the information up front, and paper returns have myTax information and then paper return options. this seems to be clunky and doesn't really flow across all 3 types of lodgement. Also the demographic that would lodge via paper are either unwilling or unable to lodge online so the myTax messaging doesn't seem to take the customer experience for this audience segment into account.

Also do most people have a my gov account? - I would suggest a choice of butttons more like _ \"I have my MyGov details - Lodge now\" / \"I need to register to get a My give account\" / or \"remind me about my MyGov Account\"   \n",

The page reads like you must have used myTax previously. There also needs to be a clearer link between myGov and myTax, people say they can lodge via myGov not myTax so we need to make the language user friendly and show some of the more common language used rather than just using ATO terms.                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Mytax was the only option that spoke of rental schedules but that didn't correlate with the scenario of multiple properties that you set at the beginning of the tasks. However as it was the only option (after clicking all three) that the words rental in it, I would choose this option to start and check to see if it was right as I progressed.  i just explained that in my last answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "35   There's a heading for 'Lodged with myTax before' heading but not one for those who haven't lodged with myTax before - shouldn't information cover both scenarios. The myTax content could be worded better. If you've lodged before you already know you can use any device and there's nothing to download. Those points would be more appropriate for those who haven't used it before. Why is there a 'Start you tax return with myTax' box followed by 3 other lodgement boxes in a different style?

       "107  The 3 different methods of lodgement have very different looks to them and are all navigated differently. myTax has little information at the top and a number of drop down information boxes that explain each heading. Tax agents just have all of the information up front, and paper returns have myTax information and then paper return options. this seems to be clunky and doesn't really flow across all 3 types of lodgement. Also the demographic that would lodge via paper are either unwilling or unable to lodge online so the myTax messaging doesn't seem to take the customer experience for this audience segment into account.

Also do most people have a my gov account? - I would suggest a choice of butttons more like _ \"I have my MyGov details - Lodge now\" / \"I need to register to get a My give account\" / or \"remind me about my MyGov Account\"   \n",

The page reads like you must have used myTax previously. There also needs to be a clearer link between myGov and myTax, people say they can lodge via myGov not myTax so we need to make the language user friendly and show some of the more common language used rather than just using ATO terms.                                                                                                                                                               \n",
